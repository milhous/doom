    "banner_desc": "Lucky Token (LUT) is a functional token on the Bitgame platform. Different from other sports betting platforms, Bitgame's unique LUT ecosystem utilizes the idea of the token economy to create a whole new token-based internal circulation ecosystem. LUT features a delayed token deflation model which gives considerable growth space for future token value and allows for participants to gain prospective yield in the future by holding LUT tokens. Users can obtain LUT by betting in more than 20 cryptocurrencies supported by the platform on sports events and online games. As long as they obtain and hold their LUT tokens on Bitgame, they can not only regularly share platform profits from the dividend pool, but also participate in platform auctions and other activities to have a chance of winning crypto.",
